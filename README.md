### Tools

- Microsoft Excel - Data Cleaning
- Looker Studio - Data Visualization / Report


### Exploratory Data Analysis

1. What is the average sleep duration per day for each age category (e.g., <20 years, 20-40 years, >40 years) in this data?
2. What is the percentage of respondents experiencing sleep disturbances (e.g., insomnia or apnea) by gender (male or female) in this data?
3. Provide information on frequencies indicating the number of respondents with sleep disturbances by sleep duration per day (e.g., <4 hours, 4-6 hours, 6-8 hours, >8 hours) in this data.
4. What is the average sleep duration per day for each type of respondent's job in this data? And is there a significant effect of occupation on sleep disturbance?
5. What are the five occupations that have the highest percentage of respondents with sleep disturbance in this data?
